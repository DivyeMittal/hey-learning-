<h1> Speech on My Ambition in Life </h1>
<h2> My Ambition in Life </h2>
<h3>every person has an ambition in life. Either it is a big one or a smaller one. But the most important thing is that, to achieve the ambition. Every person has some dreams, and they want to fulfil it. But not everyone gets a chance to fulfil their ambition. I've remembered, once I was reading a story, I found a famous quote:

“If you are seeing dreams then it is your responsibility to fulfil it.”

It means that, to have ambition isn't the matter. The matter is to fulfil it. Coming to my goals in life.

So, the goal of my life is to fulfil the expectations and dreams of my parents. My ambition is to become a big scientist and an excellent engineer and do great things in life. My ambition is to do world changing discoveries, inventions, and experiments.

Well then, what if I fail?

The most important thing in life is to try and get knowledge and experiences. Either it is success, or it is a failure both are important. If talking about success, then it is very important to gain success with a positive attitude and help others succeed with your experience. And, when we are talking about failure, then it is important to keep trying no matter what age you are in and to always teach others using your experiences of life. </h3>
